This project demonstrates our (Anthony Messana, Michael Giordano and Leah Kazenmayer's) Hotel Resource Management System for CSC 315-01. It includes all of our brainstorming, planning, diagrams and source code for the creation of our database system.
In the documents folder, it includes submissions like our EER diagram, Relational Schema, BCNF diagram, and so forth.
In the parent folder, it includes our zip file which includes our actual source code for the MGK system.
All of the steps taken for the project can be viewed in the wiki
